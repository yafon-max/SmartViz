  introText: 'Spatio-temporal Analysis System for Urban Renewal Pedestrian and Vehicle Behavior Based on Computer Vision and Digital Twins',
  backgroundText: 'This project focuses on intelligent urban renewal applications based on multi-source data, with a practical case study centered on community video data. The project involves the intelligent analysis of street video data collected from community cameras using the YOLOv5 algorithm, enabling real-time monitoring and behavioral understanding of pedestrian and vehicle flow in urban communities. By constructing a digital twin platform, it provides decision-making support and design improvement suggestions for community managers and designers, thereby enhancing the level of community facility space renovation and safety management.',
  goalText: 'By collecting and analyzing data from multiple perspectives and time points, a spatiotemporal model of community pedestrian and vehicle behavior is constructed to explore activity patterns, providing data support and technical solutions for smart community development and refined urban management.',
  methodText: 'The project employs the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm for pedestrian and vehicle flow detection and statistics in real-world environments. By integrating video frame rates and the spatial distribution of cameras, it summarizes a multi-temporal, multi-perspective data collection and analysis approach. Based on distinct spatiotemporal data characteristics, the project develops tailored solutions for various application scenarios. The analysis results are visualized through a digital twin platform, forming a closed-loop feedback system.',
